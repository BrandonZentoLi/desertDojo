      Cake &#9775;
    </h1>
    
    <p class="text">
      A baked good made from flour, sugar, and many other ingredients. The cake is almost always baked, but there are cakes that can be made with other methods as well. Originally, cakes used to be modifications of bread and eventually developed into the cakes we know now. Cake can be layered, and then finished off with toppings and icing.

          <p class = "text">
            A coffee-flavored Italian dessert. Composed of ladyfingers(a British sponge cake-like sponge cake biscuits) dipped in coffee, layered with icing, mascarpone cheese, and flavored with cocoa. Often, dessert cocoa beans are placed on top of the cake for aesthetics and also taste.

          <h1>Cheesecake</h1>
          <p class = "text">
            Another twist on the classical cake, cheesecake is (as you guessed) made of cheese as well. The thickest part of the cheesecake(which you could also say is the filling-like part) is made of a batter composed of cheese, eggs, and sugar. The bottom layer which holds the cheese together is harder, serving as a base made out of crushed cookies or graham crackers. Sometimes, sponge cake is used as well.

          <h1> Black Forest gateau</h1>
          <p class = "text">
            Another chocolate-based dessert, black forest cake is a chocolate sponge cake. Composed of multiple layers, the black forest is made of chocolate sponge cake layers sandwiched with whipped cream/icing and topped with cherries on top. There could be cherry filling in between layers as well.
