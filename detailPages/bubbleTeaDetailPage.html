      Bubble tea 珍珠奶茶(Zhēnzhū nǎichá) &#9775;
    </h1>
    
    <p class="text">
      Bubble tea is a sweet, usually chilled tea-based drink that originated in Taiwan in the early 1980s. Often times bubble tea is composed of milk-tea(milk and tea too add a creamy, smooth texture) and "bubbles"(the chewy tapioca balls or "boba" or "pearls"). Nowadays, the phrase "going for bubble tea" is much vaguer, as the variety of bubble tea is quite vast, but one thing all bubble tea shares in common are the tea base. Bubble tea can also be(sometimes) a fruit-flavored beverage.
      (Author's note: What makes bubble tea so addictive and tasty is while you're sipping the drink with a thick straw, you're not just drinking the tea itself, but sipping up and chewing on a few tapioca pearls as well.)

            The original flavor, you can never go wrong with the classic. A typical milk blend with (usually) black/earl grey tea, and a sugary base(of course). Topped off with many tapioca pearls in the bottom of the drink, classic milk bubble tea never disappoints as something to buy with your friends.

          <h1> Brown sugar bubble tea</h1>
          <p class = "text">
            A twist on the classic milk tea, but with additional brown sugar on top of the fresh milk tea blend. The cup of the drink is usually rimmed and filled with brown sugar syrup, giving it a certain aesthetic feel, or even a messy look. This drink is sometimes called dirty milk tea(due to its appearance) and tiger milk tea.

            Fruit-flavored bubble teas are the best re-fresheners during the summer, and mango bubble tea is no exception. Perhaps the most popular fruit-based bubble tea, you find this drink at literally any bubble tea shop. Often served as a mango beverage base with tapioca balls (classically), the drink can be served over crushed ice or as a slushie, and the drink often has diced mango cubes on top as well.
