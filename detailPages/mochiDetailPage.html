      Mochi &#9775;
    </h1>
    
    <p class="text">
      Mochi is a type of sweet rice cake, originating in Japan. The rice cake is made out of a material called mochigome, a short-grain japonica glutinous rice, and often mixed with water, sugar or cornstarch. Traditionally, mochi is hand pounded repeatedly to obtain the desired viscosity, and later molded into the desired shape. The original process of using and making this glutinous rice, however, was considered to have originated in ancient China.

            The traditional dessert filling of mochi, called azuki in japanese. Red bean paste has a sweet, distinctively nutty taste, which makes it really stand out from other mochi flavors. Combined with the rice paste on the outside for a very interesting texture, red bean mochi is a classic.

          <h1> Green Tea mochi </h1>
          <p class = "text">
              Green tea seemingly is always a flavor included among asian dishes and desserts. The green tea taste is quite complex, and has a very changeable tea flavor with varying degrees of bitterness. However, that counter-balance of bitterness and sweetness is what makes green tea mochi distinct.

          <p class = "text">
              Again, a twist on the classic mochi. Now, instead of a paste, you have ice cream as a filling! This opens a whole new world of diversity, as where you already had multiple flavors of mochi before, now you have even more but with ice cream instead. The creamy texture of the ice cream mixes quite well with the soft, glutinous rice wrapping, providing a sense of bliss after biting into the mochi.
