      Ice cream, without a doubt, is one of the most enjoyed treats around the world. Made from dairy milk or cream, and then sweetened with a variety of different methods, such as sugar, syrup, vanilla spices or fruits. Served on a plate, in a cup as a sundae, or even in a cone, this dessert is perfect for cooling down in the summer or getting the chills in the winter.  Ice cream has many different flavors, but often times many flavors are mixed together by using multiple scoops of each flavor.

          <p class = "text">
              The first of the big 3, vanilla ice cream. Vanilla ice cream is often considered the most basic ice cream, serving as a base for more complex flavors. But, as you may have notices, often times the most classic, basic or simple flavors among desserts are the most enjoyed. A sweet dessert, the vannila in the ice cream also provides a very very subtle salt flavor, providing almost a smoky flavor.

          <h1> Chocolate Ice Cream</h1>
          <p class = "text">
              The second flavor of the big 3, chocolate ice cream. Chocolate is also one of the world's most favourite treats as well, so obviously it is a flavor for ice cream. Chocolate ice creams go many steps further, where there's double, even triple layered chocolate ice creams. Chocolate syrup can be drizzled over ice cream, and cones often have chocolate linings inside of them to provide additional flavor.

          <h1> Strawberry Ice Cream</h1>
          <p class = "text">
            Last but not least, the strawberry ice cream. A fruity twist on ice cream, strawberry ice cream provides a sour twist to ice cream flavors. This combination of sweet and sour perfectly compliments one another, making strawberry ice cream quite popular.
